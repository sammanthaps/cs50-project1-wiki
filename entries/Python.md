Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.


Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms including:


* Structured _(particularly, procedural)_, object-oriented and functional programming. 


Python is often described as a _**"batteries included"**_ language due to its comprehensive standard library. It was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by _Guido van Rossum_ as a successor to the ABC programming language.


Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.


Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` functions; _list comprehensions_, _dictionaries_, _sets_, and _generator_ expressions. 


**_The language's core philosophy_ is summarized in the document _The Zen of Python_ (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:**


* Beautiful is better than ugly.



* Explicit is better than implicit.



* Simple is better than complex.



* Complex is better than complicated.



* Readability counts.
