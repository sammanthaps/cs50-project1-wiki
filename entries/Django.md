Django is a [Python](/wiki/Python)-based free and open-source web framework that follows the **model-template-views** _(MTV)_ architectural pattern. It is maintained by the **Django Software Foundation** _(DSF)_, an American independent organization established as a __501(c)(3)__ non-profit.

Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, _less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself_. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. 



Django also provides an optional administrative _**create, read, update and delete**_ interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.


Some well known sites that use Django include:


* PBS



* Instagram



* Mozilla



* The Washington Times



* Disqus



* Bitbucket



* Nextdoor


Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, _Adrian Holovaty_ and _Simon Willison_, began using Python to build applications. _Jacob Kaplan-Moss_ was hired early in Django's development shortly before _Simon Willison's_ internship ended.


It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist _**Django Reinhardt**_.


In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed **Django Software Foundation** _(DSF)_ would maintain Django in the future.
