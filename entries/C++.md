**C++** is a general-purpose programming language created by _**Bjarne Stroustrup**_ as an extension of the C programming language, or _"C with Classes"_. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 



It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including:



* Free Software Foundation

* LLVM

* Microsoft

* Intel,

* Oracle

* IBM

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with _performance_, _efficiency_, and _flexibility_ of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including:

* Desktop applications
* Video games
* Servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers)
* Performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
