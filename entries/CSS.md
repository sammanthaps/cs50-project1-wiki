**Cascading Style Sheets** _(CSS)_ is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript).



CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including _layout, colors, and fonts_. 



This separation can improve:



* Content accessibility.



* Provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.



* Enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate `.css` file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.



* Enable the `.css` file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.



CSS was first proposed by **Hakon Wium Lie** on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with **Tim Berners-Lee** at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by **Bert Bos** was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.



Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of _Standard Generalized Markup Language_ (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
