Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development. 

Its goals include:

* Speed

* Data integrity 

* Support for distributed, non-linear workflows _(thousands of parallel branches running on different systems)_.

Git was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, **Junio Hamano** has been the core maintainer. 

As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client-server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a _full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities_, independent of network access or a central server. Git is **free and open-source** software distributed under **GNU General Public License Version 2**.
