Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.



Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers _write once, run anywhere_ **(WORA)**, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.



The syntax of Java is similar to C and [C++](/wiki/C++), but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 



**There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:**



1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.



2. It must be robust and secure.



3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.



4. It must execute with high performance.



5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
